Over the past several months, we&#8217;ve been working closely with the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) on the launch of their open data portal and that effort will be coming to fruition in the form of a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code4Sac/events/194198702/" target="_blank">soft launch event </a>that will overlap with our regular Hack Night this Wednesday, beginning at 5 p.m.

While Code for Sacramento is a local brigade, we&#8217;re also situated in the state capital of the eighth largest economy in the world. That is, we&#8217;re the hub of policymaking and administrative activities in the state government IT space. Just take a look at <a href="http://www.techwire.net/legislative-roundup/" target="_blank">TechWire.net&#8217;s most recent legislative roundup</a> for a sample of issues state lawmakers are considering.

In addition to playing with data and deploying civic apps, Code for Sacramento is committed to solving problems that affect our region. And one of those problems just so happens to be the perception that there are &#8220;Two Sacramentos.&#8221; The State of California is our region&#8217;s largest employer, yet there&#8217;s often <a href="http://www.ppic.org/main/publication.asp?i=57" target="_blank">a disconnect within the state-local relationship</a>. The Sacramento with statewide responsibility often overlooks the Sacramento with local concerns, so the argument goes.

Now we can&#8217;t solve all of the challenges facing the state, but using <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/our-work/initiatives/" target="_blank">Code for America&#8217;s tools</a> and &#8220;simple, beautiful, and easy to use&#8221; ethos, we&#8217;re well-positioned to help state officials show what&#8217;s possible. So we were excited, to say the least, when CDPH&#8217;s Tamara Srzentic reached out to us.

Tamara went way beyond what you might normally expect from a traditional public engagement process. Because her team was committed to building the portal *with* us, not just *for* us, she held a design thinking workshop with our members to evaluate how CDPH could deploy a portal that met the needs of users. Of course, civic technologists aren&#8217;t the only users of open data portals, so we collaboratively developed several user personas to segment content needs by the different reasons each type of user would visit the site. We were also excited to hear that the portal vendor, <a href="http://www.socrata.com/" target="_blank">Socrata</a>, welcomed this fresh approach to portal design.

Let&#8217;s be honest: local brigades don&#8217;t always have public servants eager to work with us; many in government still view civic innovation as outside their area of responsibility. So it&#8217;s not just the engagement we appreciate, but the opportunity to impact something that will be deployed at a statewide scale for all Californians to use. It&#8217;s also a responsibility we take seriously.

We&#8217;re super-excited to be coding for California. And not just because we want to tackle issues at the state-level, but because a public agency is proactively engaging us in the process. We also want to help our sister brigades in California get access to the open data from other state agencies they need to build the interfaces they want to see in their communities.

So how can we help you? Drop us a line at hello [at] codeforsacramento [dot] org.
