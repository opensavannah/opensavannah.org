Many thanks to everyone who dropped in to Hacker Lab on Saturday to check out CodeAcross!

We got down to business with a few great projects:

#### US City Open Data Census

Run by the Open Knowledge Foundation, the Open Data Census offers a fantastic scorecard-style summary of how governments around the world measure up when it comes to making their data open and accessible. Code4Sac volunteers used the Open Knowledge Foundation website to work through a guided series of questions about Sacramento&#8217;s data. By the  end of the day on Saturday, Sacramento ranked 2nd out of the 20 cities who participated!

There&#8217;s certainly more research to do. To view the details on our successes and opportunities in Sacramento, check out the page <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/place/sacramento" target="_blank">here</a>. US City rankings can be found <a href="http://us-city.census.okfn.org/" target="_blank">here</a>.

*Action items: *

  * Recruit 1-2 volunteers to sign up as Sacramento census reviewers with Code for America (and ask the City if they have volunteer reviewers as well!)
  * Use the ODC as a roadmap for engaging the City on open data possibilities
  * Draft memo to City of Sacramento for open data kudos and national comparisons

#### Sacramento Infographics and Data Visualizations

The City has open data and Code4Sac has designers!  What&#8217;s been missing are the analysts and tools needed to explore the data and deliver findings to our visual storytellers.

Lucky for us, Andy is working on building an interactive mapping tool to help people explore what&#8217;s inside datasets like Sacramento&#8217;s list of trees and street parking file. When folks have a simple way to interact with complex data on a map, it sparks new ideas and inspires new projects.

And also lucky for us, our old friend Justine stopped by and showed us a thing or two about adding neighborhood maps to Sacramento&#8217;s list of trees! We&#8217;re looking forward to having some neat facts to share with designers Nick and Miguel so they can start crafting new stories about what&#8217;s going on in our city.

#### Community Services Data

One of the things we&#8217;d like to do in Sacramento is make community services data (aka human services data, 211 data, or information and referral data) more available. As Code for America moves forward with its OpenReferral Initiative, more tools are becoming available to help make that happen&#8230; things like data standards, APIs, and terminology systems. Demonstration projects at the local level will inform the development of these tools for the benefit of everyone.

So&#8230; in Sacramento, the good folks at 211 Sacramento are interested in working with Code4Sac to make their data more open. Talks are preliminary and one of the first steps is to have a look at their data to explore what&#8217;s possible. We got a good start on that yesterday when Risto wrote a script to pull public data from 211 Sac&#8217;s public website. You can find what he made for us <a href="https://github.com/Risto-Stevcev/icarol_scraper" target="_blank">here</a>. Now we have sample of about 70 records including agency names, service descriptions, and website addresses to review and plan next steps with the folks at 211. Most excellent!!

Action items:

  * Compare what&#8217;s in the sample file with what&#8217;s required for the Ohana API. Make a list of what&#8217;s missing.
  * Use the OpenEligibility taxonomy to categorize what&#8217;s in the sample file, make a pretty 1 page report for 211 Sacramento
  * Conference with 211 Sacramento and brainstorm next steps!

All in all, it was a very productive CodeAcross for us in Sacramento. Huge thanks to everyone who attended and helped make the event possible. And a big thanks to Laura for tweeting our stories yesterday! Finally, huge shout out to <a href="http://hackerlab.org" target="_blank">Hacker Lab</a> for allowing us to host our gathering in their space &#8212; complete with Wifi, projectors, whiteboards,  kitchen tools and promo &#8212; all for free.
