Afternoon brigadiers,

Last week we went through a change of leadership here at Code4Sac. One of our Captains Hailey Pate has moved on to other interests. For more information, see her message to the google group <a title="here" href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/code4sac/KpaZTCyDrNI/O2Dd2gb2jrYJ" target="_blank">here</a>.

During this transition period, we will be refocusing and building the leadership team back up by recruiting for Core Team Members and scaling back our hack nights to once a month on the last wednesday of each month. This will give the core team time to refocus, and build the necessary structure to make Code4Sac efficient as possible.

If being on the core team sounds interesting to you, see the <a href="http://code4sac.org/core-team-member-interest/" target="_blank">post on core team interest</a>.

If you have any questions, please direct them to kclark <at> codeforamerica <dot> org

Thank you,  
-Kaleb Clark
