Good turnout tonight. We had a grand total of 13 hackers, which 4 were new to Code4Sac. Also, plenty of pizza! One of the new members is a GIS person, hooray! He is going to help us get better neighborhood data for the Hashtag project.

**Hashtag Map update:**  
Andy and Kaleb worked out how to merge the two existing hashtag repos into a single project, what the data delivery from the backend to the front end would look like etc. The backend of the app is a suite of daemons that connects to the twitter streaming API, so it is taking a little extra effort in getting that setup for testing. We are going to host the daemons on a members personal dedicated host until we can find a hosting solution for the app.
