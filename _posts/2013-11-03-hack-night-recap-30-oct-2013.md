  <h5>
    1.  Possible new location and schedule for weekly Hack Nights
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    We’re considering this because:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Many CfA Brigades hold their hack nights at city/county facilities to be more visible to municipal staff and enhance collaboration on projects
    </li>
    <li>
      Hacker Lab’s busiest meeting days are Wednesdays and they have lots of premium meeting space available on Sundays and Mondays
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Discussion – Hailey asked the group for thoughts. Key points:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Meeting on the same night every week is really high value, as is meeting at the same place. This is a “premium” that makes it easier to get more people involved and attending.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is support for holding meetings at City facilities so we can get to know city staff better and they can learn more about us
    </li>
    <li>
      Moving hack nights to Mondays would free us up for other events during the week (such as CivicMeet). Wednesday is the most popular night for meetups, and there are some other cool meetings that Code4Sac might want to attend.
    </li>
    <li>
      We have not yet confirmed what type of space is available for us at the City, nor do we know when/how often we could use it. It could be weekly, it could be once per month. Moving our Hacker Lab hack nights to Mondays would free us up during the week to add a special hack night with the city once per month
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Takeways
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We can’t really make a strategic change without knowing what’s available from the City. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hailey will follow up with Steve Hansen’s office before next Wednesday to get an update on our options.</span> Will need to re-discuss with C4S volunteers. A decision on meeting day/place would be nice to have before Thanksgiving.

    2.  CivicData.com provides free CKAN-based data portal services to municipalities and CfA Brigades.
  </h5>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      We can use this resource for the next iteration of the Code4Sac data portal.
    </li>
    <li>
       Kaleb has set up a Code4Sac account, more details coming soon

    1.  Follow-up pitch from Forrest – Sac County 311 Data
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    Presentation:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Forrest talked with us about a super cool data set housed by the County of Sacramento. It contains 311 data – information about requests for County services – dating from 2005 to 2013.
    </li>
    <li>
      The County is preparing to deploy a new 311 system. Forrest says they may not have plans to archive the data currently housed by the soon-to-be legacy 311 system.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Discussion
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      There are several options for approaching the County about releasing this data. One is to make a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Since the data is not natively stored in flat files, and because it includes personally identifiable information (names of requestors, etc) – processing the request will be time consuming – which means costly. We don’t want to place an undue burden on the County, especially during our first formal encounter with them.
    </li>
    <li>
      An alternative to submitting a FOIA request would be to approach the County and pitch a project. This way, we could potentially collaborate on preparing the data, make it so that County doesn’t have to do as much work, and maybe get a better data product for everyone as a result.
    </li>
    <li>
      The first part of pitching a project is making the business case. Hailey had an ask for the C4S crew: <ul>
        <li>
           We&#8217;re looking for strong examples of how opening 311 data has returned value to government agencies. If you have 20-30 minutes to spend researching examples, it would really help us.
        </li>
        <li>
           For each example, we will need to know at least three things: <ol>
            <li>
              The name of the city/county/state
            </li>
            <li>
              The type of data that was made available
            </li>
            <li>
              How the data solved a problem (i.e. how much decrease in savings? in staff time on task? how much increase in efficiency? in quality of services delivered to the public?
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          Places to look for ideas: <ul>

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Please post findings/success stories to the Google Group</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      If we’re able to get data, it can go on the data portal at <a href="http://civicdata.com/" target="_blank">civicdata.com</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Next steps are to draft the pitch and approach the County about scheduling a meeting to hear it. Forrest has some contact recommendations for us.
    </li>
  </ul>

    2.  Hashtag Project
  </h5>
  
  <p>
    Public Innovation wants to hold another Civic Meet to support Mary Jayne&#8217;s hashtag project. Now that Code4Sac has built a prototype for a hashtag heatmap, many questions were raised about directions for the project and where to go for updates. There is a trello board that many folks in the community have been using to communicate about the project, and Emma shared that link with the Code4Sac google group.
