Thats right folks, time has yet again chugged along into the new year, seemingly with ever increasing pace. Making no stops and holding on to nothing. Teaching us patience and urgency. As we enter an election year, the soil of government is being tilled and worked over. In order for government to work, and work well, we the people must work together to communicate our needs. A computer is a powerful machine, but without a program to run it or give it instructions, it may as well be a paperweight. Likewise, a government by the people, for the people, can not operate succinctly without proper input from the people. As with any system, there are multiple ways to go about this, some of which a large number of citizens either don’t know, don’t care about, or can’t care about because of their own day to day struggles. One of Code for Sacramento’s goals is to serve as a bridge between those citizens and their government.

At Code for Sacramento, we use technology to facilitate civic engagement, in partnership with government, to improve quality of life in the Sacramento region. As we prepare our strategic plan for the year to come, our main focus is measurable results. We want to hear from you; citizens, community leaders, government officials and the like, to create real progress in our region. We invite you to our first Code for Sacramento meet-up of 2016 on Wednesday, January 13th at Hacker Lab. You can RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/Code4Sac/events/227908408/?a=socialmedia).

We look forward to seeing you all there!
