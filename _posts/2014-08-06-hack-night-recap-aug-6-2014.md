## **Announcements-**

**The following comes Direct from the CDPH**

On <span data-term="goog_1464347233">Friday, August 8, 2014</span>, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) will be the first California Health & Human Services department to launch its Open Data Portal, a project funded by the California HealthCare Foundation. The portal will provide the public with unprecedented user friendly access to publicly available data from CDPH. The goal of the Open Data Portal is to promote greater government efficiency and effectiveness and support entrepreneurship, innovation and discovery.

You are cordially invited to join us in exploring and leveraging health data to empower Californians, spur innovation, and inspire creative collaboration to improve the quality of our state’s health care delivery system, and public health overall.  The program will commence at <span data-term="goog_1464347234">10:00 a.m.</span> in the auditorium located at 1500 Capitol Avenue in Sacramento and is scheduled to conclude at <span data-term="goog_1464347235">11:30am</span>. Following the formal program, stakeholders, partners and agencies will be invited to review, engage and provide ideas and feedback in a learning lab.

We hope that you will be able to join us personally at this event. So that we may plan for attendance, please RSVP to <opendata@cdph.ca.gov>.

Sincerely, The CDPH Open Data Team
