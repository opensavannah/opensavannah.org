**New to hack nights? **Every first Wednesday of the month, we have our onboarding meetup for newcomers. We&#8217;ll introduce you to everyone, answer any questions you have and find a project and team for you to join.

If you&#8217;ve never been to a hack night or are new to the idea of Code for America, this is the perfect meetup for you to attend!

**You&#8217;ve attended the onboarding meetup. Now what? **Now  come to our weekly hack nights! Our weekly hack nights are our chance to roll up our sleeves and code together. By now, you have probably been assigned to a project and know how you can contribute. We work on our [projects][1] while eating pizza and brainstorming possible solutions. A lot of the time, we geek out on new apps and technologies together.

**When you plan on attending a hack night, remember to bring your laptop and charger!** Everything we do&#8211;whether it&#8217;s coding, designing, writing content, OpenStreetMapping, etc.&#8211;is done on our laptops. We&#8217;ll provide the WiFi and pizza, you provide your skills and laptop.

**Missed a meetup? **Life happens. We document everything that happens at each hack night here in our blog.
