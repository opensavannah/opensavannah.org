#Roll Call!
Wednesday Standups are our weekly standup meeting, where we meet up to hear from a great speaker, and share our progress, new ideas, and challenges.
The Roll Call is where we ask everyone to add their name, and any contact info they're comfortable sharing publicly, so that we can all keep in touch over the next week and beyond.
