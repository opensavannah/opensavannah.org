The Sac2050 Quality of Life Civic Datathon is a half-day event to crowdsource key quality of life indicator data. That data will be used to create a dynamic dashboard ([Sac2050.org](http://sac2050.org)) as a foundation for a regional conversation about where we’re at, where we want to go, and how we’re going to get there.

Code for Sacramento is forming a broad-based coalition of stakeholders committed to shaping the future of the Sacramento region. Inspired by the Blueprint process of the early 2000s that modeled future transportation and land use planning, We're convening residents to set goals in all quality of life areas:

- The Economy
- K-12 and Higher Education
- Health and Families
- Public Safety
- Environmental Sustainability
- Transportation and Housing

Before we set goals for the future, though, we need to better understand where we're at and how we got here.

### How the Datathon Works
At the Sac2050 Civic Datathon, participants will be divided into teams based on their interest area. Each team will have a list of datasets to collect, clean, and publish. Participants do not need to have a strong technical background, but should have basic spreadsheet proficiency (e.g., ability to sort, filter, delete columns, save as CSV, etc.). Detailed instructions will be provided to registered participants prior to the event.

In addition to participants who can assist with data collection, we’re interested in working with subject matter experts with strong writing skills to develop content and illuminate stories from the data. We’re also recruiting team leads with skills in cat herding to help organize the data collection process and ensure that participants are able to source their assigned dataset(s), along with providing minimal technical assistance.

Code for Sacramento will use the crowdsourced data to generate interactive, web-based data visualizations at Sac2050.org. We hope to develop Sac2050.org into a platform that helps our region transcend the short-term thinking that drives quarterly reports and annual budgets to develop a vision for the future that will empower the next two generations.
