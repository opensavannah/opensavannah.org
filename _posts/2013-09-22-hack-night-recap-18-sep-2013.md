This hack night ended with a gathering on the back porch at Streets of London! We covered a picnic table in laptops and talked about the website, recruiting, and finding new projects. The highlights:

Website:

  * The crew would like to see more dynamic contact on the front page. Hailey and Andy will work together to make room for recent posts under the landing page header.
  * Andy will continue to work on harmonizing the look and feel of the site across various mobile and desktop devices.
  * Hailey will create a section on the website to feature editorial-style posts from our volunteers.
  * Andy will look into GitHub integration.

Recruiting

  * Emma drafted a slide deck for orienting new members to the group. It&#8217;s still a work in progress, but we plan to use it on the first Wednesday of every month to help spread the message of who we are and how folks can get involved.
  * Discussed member retention &#8211; Â all agreed that informative website and user-friendly discussion groups are key for attracting civic enthusiasts and encouraging them to come back for more!

New projects

  * This one is tough because our members have varied interests and we need to keep people engaged.
  * All agreed that we need a steady balance of projects which will return value directly back to the Sacramento community.
  * Small projects are a good way to quickly demonstrate our enthusiasm and show what we&#8217;re all about.
  * Emma suggested visualization of data by neighborhood, potentially based on Twitter data and local hashtags.

Check back next week to see what we were able to mark off the list!
