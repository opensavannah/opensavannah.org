At Code4Sac, we want to build an awesome community that delivers great software and hardware to the people of Sacramento. To accomplish those goals, we&#8217;ve identified a few key criteria for Code4Sac projects:

  * **Make life better for the people of Sacramento.**
  * **Attract experienced developers.**
  * **Educate less-experienced developers.**
  * **Harness the skills and experience of non-techies. **

To make sure Code4Sac projects are meeting those criteria, we’ve come up with some questions every pitch and standup should answer.

#### How will this project make life better for the people of Sacramento?

There are lots of ways of making life better. Is your project <a title="Oxygen, Aspirin, Jewelery" href="http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/janet-krauss-how-to-test-the-vitality-of-your-startup-idea.html" target="_blank">oxygen, aspirin, or jewelry</a>? Oxygen projects are essential, the type of thing people can&#8217;t live without: food, shelter, Google. Aspirin projects are not necessarily essential, but they make life a lot less painful: transportation, coffee, Amazon. Jewelry projects are things that no one *needs* but that make life much more pleasurable: video games, ice cream, Instagram.

If you&#8217;re looking for some examples of projects that fit the Code4Sac spirit, <a title="Code for America Apps & APIs" href="http://codeforamerica.org/apps/" target="_blank">check out the work of our parent organization</a>, Code for America.

#### Can you take responsibility for delivering this project?

If you can&#8217;t show up to work on your project, who will? This doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to be able to implement every aspect of your project, but you do need to think about why developers who *can* implement your project would want to work on it. Every developer is different, but here are some of the things we&#8217;ve heard from experienced developers about why they come to Code4Sac:

> I want to work on challenging problems.
> 
> I want to make a difference.
> 
> I want to work with exciting new technologies.
> 
> I want to have fun doing what I love.

Keep in mind that if people want to work on your project, you still have to show up to to make it happen! We recommend getting a couple people involved who are willing to standup for your project if you have to miss a hack night.

#### What can less-experienced developers learn by working on this project?

Awesome communities help their members grow. One of the reasons people come to Code4Sac is to learn from their more experienced peers. We want to be a resource for younger or less-experienced developers, so that they can be a resource for us as they build their skills. Providing learning opportunities can be as simple as offering to answer questions about the programming language or framework your project uses, but bonus points if you can offer a training session that will give less-experienced developers a chance to work on your project, for example:

> We&#8217;ll be setting up our Github repo tonight, if anyone wants to learn some git basics.

#### What can non-technical people do to help?

We know that &#8220;code&#8221; is in our name, but we also know that it takes a lot more than just code to make a project successful. Maybe your project needs crisp graphic design, or deep data analysis, or well-written copy. We’ve had expert volunteers in all of these fields, and more. Let them know how they can make your project awesome!

#### Anything else?

We hope these questions will help build the Code4Sac community and increase the impact of Code4Sac projects. If *you* have any questions about pitches or standups, please find a core team member at a hack night, or just [drop us an email][1].
