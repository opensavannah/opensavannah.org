<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Tonight, Andy and Kaleb gave us a demo of the Twitter hashtag map they&#8217;ve been working on. So far, they&#8217;ve captured over 4000 tweets that feature at least one of 42 Sacramento neighborhood hashtags. Very cool!</span>

In their work to gather and present the data, the team noticed that some hashtags seem to be popular in other states or countries. As a result, those hashtags return a high percentage of tweets that aren&#8217;t relevant to Sacramento. The team plans to connect with Mary Jayne to discuss the possibility of refining some of the &#8220;noisiest&#8221; tags to make them more usable for Sacramentans. There may also be additional steps Code4Sac programmers could take to eliminate some of the extra tweets from the heat map. More than likely, the best solution might involve a combination of both approaches.

Tonight, we also got a first look at Jay&#8217;s visualization of Sac City budget data using a free version of Tableau software. Lots of charts and colorful graphs&#8230; very cool!

The Hashtag project and Hack the Map projects now have their own repositories on [Code4Sac&#8217;s github page][1]. In addition to hosting sets of project files for coders to work on, each repo also contains its own issues list and wiki. Both coders and non-coders can use these features to share &#8220;to do&#8221; lists, report and resolve bugs, and also document project work plans. Super handy!!!

Last but not least, Kaleb built a snappy new plugin that displays our GitHub activity on the project pages of the Code4Sac main website. That code is also [available on GitHub][2]. Thanks Kaleb!
