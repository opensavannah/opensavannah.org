Two weeks ago, Code For Sacramento hosted the [Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates](http://sacbike.org/)' Executive Director Jim Brown. Jim came to us a few weeks back with a problem: SABA does quarterly bike counts on Sacramento streets. These counts require volunteers to watch an intersection for two hours and count every time a bicycle enters the intersection, including collecting certain demographic information. Up until now, these counts were mainly handled on paper with sheets that would have to be tallied and deciphered, then entered into a database. As this was a volunteer effort, there came some issues around consistency with data collection.

Thankfully, a volunteer named Bill Leddy created a mobile app for Android and iOS that was able to handle bike counts and submit the count information to SABA's database lead. This app worked well for years, but sadly is in an inoperable state at this time. Bill came to us as well and was able to provide all of the logic specs for the app, which is a huge step in working on a mobile app for SABA.

To give a basic outline, SABA needs a count app that will note the following:

* Where a cyclist comes in and leaves an intersection
* The cyclist's gender (an important data point for demographic studies around cycling)
* Whether the cyclists is on the sidewalk or the street.

This data collection goes a long way in informing policymakers as to how to design streets to be better designed for multiple modes of transit. For example, if an intersection is noted with many cyclists biking on the sidewalk, that could be an indication that cyclists do not feel safe biking in the streets. Additionally, Jim mentioned that there has been a decrease in proportion of women cyclists, which has been supported by bike count figures across the nation. 

Code 4 Sac is in the technical planning phases at this point in the project and we hope to produce a solution that will not only be easy for volunteers to use, but will also make the bike count process much more efficient. While this project is being built with SABA in mind, it is highly applicable to many of the other bicycling and pedestrian advocacy groups around the country. We need folks to help out in the following areas:

* **App development**: Developers can find discussions and selection of technical stack in the [repo](https://github.com/code4sac/bikecounter). Check out our issues and help add features!
* **Design**: Web design skills are needed to make the app both look good, but also be usable.
* **Marketing**: Help us contact other pedestrian and cycling organizations to see if they would be interested in using our counts system!
