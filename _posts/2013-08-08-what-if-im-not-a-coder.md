Want to help out your city but don&#8217;t have a coding background? Great news. You don&#8217;t have to be a coder to hack with us!

Every project and hackathon team needs different non-technical skill sets. The success of these apps rely on more than good code. Our projects need:

**Project managers**: to keep the team organized.

**Recorders**: to document what decisions and updates are made so future volunteers can pick up where they left off.

**Designers**: to make the project look beautiful.

**Problem solvers/subject matter experts**: to provide knowledge on the issue we&#8217;re solving and help the team get unstuck.

**Presenters** (for hackathons): to eloquently demo the app in front of a judge panel and large audience.

Still not sure? Here are some brigade activities in which you can participate w/out coding skills:

  * Draft and publish open data strategy for your city
  * Source challenges by conducting interviews, creating and publishing challenge briefs
  * Curate apps and organizations in the Civic Commons Marketplace
  * Liberate public data from closed systems
  * Raise funds for an app or a Brigade

Now that you know what you can bring to the table, join Code4Sac and get involved at our weekly hack nights or hackathons. Your city needs you and your skills&#8211;technical or not!

Still not sure how you&#8217;ll fit in? Email us at hello [at] codeforsacramento [dot] org. I&#8217;m confident we&#8217;ll find a way to get you involved or a team for you to join.
