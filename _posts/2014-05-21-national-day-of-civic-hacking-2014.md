Code for Sacramento needs your help! As California&#8217;s capital city, we want to put Sacramento on the map as a mecca for civic hacking. Saturday, May 31st is <a href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> and your chance to help make that happen. There are tons of open source civic apps that have been deployed across the country and we want to redeploy as many of those apps as possible during NDoCH to show what our tech community is capable of.

We especially need Python/Django and Ruby on Rails developers who have experience deploying apps on Digital Ocean. If that&#8217;s you, <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/code4sac-presents-national-day-of-civic-hacking-2014-tickets-11683825637" target="_blank">sign up on the event registration page right now</a>.

Four apps we&#8217;re really interested in include:

  * <a href="http://openplans.org/shareabouts/" target="_blank">Shareabouts</a>: a flexible tool for gathering public input, such as the identification of unsafe intersections for pedestrians to cross.
  * <a href="https://www.opentreemap.org/" target="_blank">OpenTreeMap</a>: a collaborative platform for crowdsourced tree inventory, ecosystem services calculations, urban forestry analysis, and community engagement.
  * <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apps/honolulu-answers/" target="_blank">Honolulu Answers</a>: a platform that allows residents to search for answers about city services as if they were typing questions into Google.
  * <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/apps/adopt-a-hydrant/" target="_blank">Adopt-a-Hydrant</a>: an application that allows citizens to &#8220;adopt&#8221; civic infrastructure, such as storm drains or streetlights.

You&#8217;re welcome to bring your own project, too. If you have any questions, hit us up at hello@codeforsacramento.org.
