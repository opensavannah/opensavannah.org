What comes to mind when you hear the word, &#8220;hacker?&#8221; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re imagining someone in their basement hijacking websites late at night to steal personal information. Perhaps that&#8217;s what a hacker was back in the 80s (thank you, [War Games][1]!), but the hacker has been redefined since then.

In other words, hackers are not all criminals! A hacker is &#8220;someone who uses a minimum of resources and a maximum of brainpower and ingenuity to create, enhance, or fix something.&#8221; (from [hackforchange.org/blog][2])

Hackers are also known as software people. Here&#8217;s the most recent definition of software people given at [500startup][3]&#8216;s [unSEXY conference][4]:

> <span style="font-size: large;">Software people are able to see the world through the lens of software&#8230;[they] solve problems with magnetic particles.</span>  
> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">-Jeff Lawson CEO and Cofounder &#8211; Twilio</span>

The common theme here is that software people, hackers and civic hackers alike want to solve problems. They want to make living easier and more pleasant by providing a phenomenal user experience in these problem-solving apps or websites.

And contrary to what most people think, there&#8217;s more to building apps than code (although code is obviously vital), and the only difference between software people and civic hackers is the area of focus. Civic hackers focus on solving issues relevant to their neighborhood or city.

At Code4Sac, we are frequently asked  [how people can get involved without any coding skills][5]. Don&#8217;t you dare get discouraged&#8211;a coding background just is not necessary! A fair portion of civic hackers are coders, but 100% of them are able to solve issues with technology.

> <span style="font-size: large;">We are the army of 1s and 0s.</span>  
> <span style="font-size: xx-small;">-Jeff  Lawson (again)</span>

Community problems just won&#8217;t solve themselves. Your city needs civic hackers like you to improve the lives of everyone in your community. Will you join the army of 1s and 0s?
