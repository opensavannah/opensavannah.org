This week, Richard and I (Elizabeth) moseyed down to San Francisco to rep Code4Sac at the annual Code for America Summit, which brings together all kinds of people to spend three days talking about civic innovation. Attendees include fellows ([read more about the CfA fellowship][1]), brigade reps like Richard and I, government-tech & open data companies, & government folks (mayors, city innovation officers, policy makers, etc).

Hopping from workshop to lecture to roundtable discussion, Richard and I soaked up new ideas, expanded the Code4Sac network, and indulged in the free cheese, cookies, chips, crackers (and, ahem, beer).

From the [Detroit Water Project][2] to the [Laboratorio para la Ciudad][3], the summit showed off the power of civic innovation. And our own [findWIC ][4]raked in a whole lot of enthusiasm as well.

A couple of major takeaways, with a couple of ways you can pitch in:

1. There are **lots of open source projects** out there that other brigades, fellows and others have done all the hard work on. Some we might be able to implement in Sacramento are: <a style="color: #0088cc;" href="http://onebusaway.org/">OneBusAway</a><span style="color: #222222;">, </span><a style="color: #0088cc;" href="http://servicetracker.cityofchicago.org/">311 Service Tracker</a>, <a style="color: #0088cc;" href="http://chicagoflushots.org/">Flu Shot Finder</a><span style="color: #222222;">, and </span><a style="color: #0088cc;" href="http://596acres.org/">596 Acres</a>. If any of these look interesting, or you know of other open source projects we could put to use, [chime in over at the message boards][5].

2. We want to **expand our local network**, especially with local non-profits, community organizers, community colleges, and other areas that might be able to put a developer or two to work. If you&#8217;re one of these people, or are plugged into those areas, come to a meeting and join the conversation, or [chime in over at the message boards][5]. (See at least I&#8217;m consistent)
