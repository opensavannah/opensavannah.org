We often get asked, &#8220;How can non-coders Code for Sacramento?&#8221; It&#8217;s a great question and one we need to be prepared for at tomorrow&#8217;s <a href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking</a> event where we plan to deploy several civic apps.

While deploying an app can involve significant work, deployment is just the beginning. For us, it&#8217;s a question of sustainability: How do civic apps endure? How do we test for usability? And how do we ensure that we&#8217;re actually solving a real problem? These are but a few of the questions to consider when deploying a civic app.

That&#8217;s where the non-coders in the room can play a critical role. And there&#8217;s a perfect tool for answering these key questions. It&#8217;s called the <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf" target="_blank">Business Model Canvas</a>. At its core, the canvas is a roadmap for product strategyâ€“it takes a comprehensive view of not only how to bring an idea into reality, but to also ensure that reality achieves its full potential:



While it might initially seem like this is solely a tool for businesses, it can be applied to almost anything. As a civic organization, we&#8217;re not selling apps. However, if we think about our &#8220;customers&#8221; as instead our &#8220;stakeholders,&#8221; it becomes more clear the value we can add to our app deployment simply by segmenting those stakeholders into different buckets. For example, any app will have:

  * Users of the app
  * Future developers
  * Organizations who might benefit from the app&#8217;s use
  * Public agencies who may want to support continued development

Just thinking about these four groups, you can see that the outreach involved to sustain an app can be quite intensive. So if you&#8217;re joining us as a non-coder, we invite you to help us answer these key questions. We&#8217;ve laid them out in the embedded slide deck below:
