**_You can help build the movement for a more open and equitable Coastal Georgia; no tech experience is necessary. Here’s how!_**

OpenSavannah began in 2017 as a group of volunteers, trying to build technology for Savannahians, by Savannahians. Since then, a lot of amazing things have happened, including two (2) $10,000 grants from SEDA in late 2016 and numerous national recognitions from Code for America as being a leading brigade among all 77 cities in the Code for America network. As a result, our OpenSavannah “civic hacking brigade” is transforming from a bunch of volunteers ordering a pizza to an inclusive and broad-based nonprofit of people dedicated to creative solutions to make our community better, as well as supporting the larger civic ecology around us. This will require formalizing the structure of our leadership team – and possibly obtaining independent 501(c)(3) status – to broaden our impact.

**With all this change, we need new ideas and new people to contribute their time to keep us moving in the right direction. And we need your help.**

Saved by the Brigade: The New Class
-----------------------------------

We are looking for people to make a one year commitment to become part of OpenSavannah’s leadership team. We’ve got a number of roles and responsibilities we need help with, and these can be divided among responsible parties in a few different ways. Our two primary lead positions are Delivery and Community Engagement; we absolutely need to bring a couple of folks on to fill these roles. We also need help with event organizing and communicating, and these roles can be filled by other individuals or teams, or they can be added to the roles of the two main leads. If you want to help, but don’t feel ready to take on a lead role, you can also let us know you’re interested in providing support in one or more of these areas. Read on for more detailed job descriptions.

We've historically been an all volunteer organization. That said, we recognize that we may need to formalize the way we operate and ensure our ongoing sustainability by providing some compensation for some of this work in the very near future. But we're going to leave that up to you to decide. We've decided to wait to make such a decision by majority vote until the new Core Team members have been onboarded for at least two months and can have an informed say in the decision. Specifically, the Delivery and Community Engagement leads can be paid for up to half a day’s work each week at a rate of $40 per hour. Additional opportunities for work and compensation may arise as we run flagship data-jams, hackathons and other events and find opportunities to contract with government. However, know that you’re signing on for a job that compensates primarily in the knowledge that you’ve helped your community. But even unpaid, these roles will look great on a resume!

What you’ll get to do:

- Develop valuable leadership and management skills, building and leading a team in your functional area
- Own a functional area of OpenSavannah operations
- Work closely with the Senior Advisory Team to define outcomes aligned with strategic initiatives
- Work with a team of smart, passionate individuals committed to improving Savannah
- Help support the growing Sacramento tech community and work with community organizers to make tech that works for the most vulnerable in our region.
- Create processes and infrastructure that will shape the future of OpenSavannah.
- Work on things that matter!

What benefits you'll receive

- Complimentary Community-Level Membership at [The Labs at The Creative Coast](https://thecreativecoast.org) and all the benefits that come with it.
- Use of a Microsoft Surface Laptop on loan for the duration of your tenure as a member of Leadership Team (if you don't currently have access to a personal laptop).
- Reimbursement for all gas/transportation costs to Brigade events.
– Access to OpenSavannah semi-private office space at The Creative Coast when available.
– Free airfare, hotel, and ticket costs to attend Code for America's annual Summit in Oakland, Ca. (May 30-June 1) and Brigade Congress in Philadelphia (Sept. 8-10, 2019).

What we’ll ask from you:

- 1-year commitment through the end of June 2020
- Participate in biweekly leadership team strategic planning meetings
- Provide monthly update to the Lead Organizer
- Regularly attend monthly Community Action Nights, when possible, and larger OpenSavannah flagship events
- Reliably support team members and drive outcomes

[**Are you interested? Great! Please let us know by filling out this quick form before Monday, January 16, 2017!**](https://codeforsacramento.typeform.com/to/DTlt66)

Again, thanks for your interest! We’re excited to hear from you. If you have questions or thoughts, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Code for Sacramento Lead Roles
------------------------------

**Delivery Lead: The What**

Many of our members have great ideas for projects, but often those ideas can stagnate without the right combination of skills, partnership, and organization. The **Delivery Lead** advises maintainers on how to thoughtfully advance their project through development stages to create a truly impactful product. He/She is also responsible for managing projects that Code for Sacramento itself undertakes in conjunction with (and potentially under contract with) government and community partners. The person in this role needs to have a general knowledge of all active projects and communicate regularly with project maintainers. For this position, a person should be well-organized, proactive in communicating, and maintain a general knowledge of tech processes.

Points of ownership include (but are not limited to):

- Defining strategy for project development standards and processes
- Supporting teams and projects as they grow
- Managing Code for Sacramento projects
- Collecting problem statements from partner organizations
- Working closely with the Community Engagement Lead to pair members with appropriate projects

**Community Engagement Lead: The Who**

As a volunteer-based group, it’s important to provide our members with a positive, fulfilling experience. Civic innovation is driven by engaged individuals, and our role is to bring those people together to make real change happen. The **Community Engagement Lead** focuses on creating value for brigade members and growing the community. Ideally, the person in this role works very well with all personality types, can effectively articulate the mission of Code for Sacramento, and holds a general knowledge of the civic tech community in the larger Sacramento context.

Points of ownership include (but are not limited to):

- Recruiting new members and retaining current members
- Creating an on-boarding process for new community members
- Communicating with newcomers and working closely with the Delivery Lead to match skills with project needs
- Identify member goals at all levels and helping members achieve those goals

**Events: The When and Where**

Between weekly hack nights, larger thematic hackathons, collaborative programming, and conferences, we have a lot of events (often simultaneously). For a seamless experience, we need help with event logistics and planning, including catering, location, materials and setup, participant experience, etc. Our current plan is to divide this role up among members of the core team, so that each person is responsible for a fraction of our events. We welcome the interest of outgoing, personable individuals to take on all or a portion of this workload.

Points of ownership include (but are not limited to):

- Arranging details of weekly hack night
- Finding and coordinating with hack night speakers
- Assisting with logistics of hackathon events; oversee schedule; secure space for events
- Communicate with sponsors regarding food/drinks; set up space with refreshments, working materials, promo materials

**Communications: The Why**

At OpenSavannah, we do a lot of cool stuff. The doing part is easy and fun, but the telling part isn’t so obvious. We can always use help in artfully telling the story of our community. This means strategizing marketing/public relations, documenting member projects and efforts, soliciting and interacting with press, and establishing a metrics structure. For this role, the right match is someone strongly interested in crafting narratives, having a sense of interactive marketing practices, and confidently representing OpenSavannah.

Points of ownership include (but are not limited to):

- Defining communications strategy at large
- Telling the OpenSavannah story and project stories
- Engaging the community
- Generating original content to demonstrate impact
- Promoting events and projects as needed
