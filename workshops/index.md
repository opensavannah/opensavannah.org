 <img src="http://cvlassets.s3.amazonaws.com/open-savannah-workshops.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 350px;"/>


Starting Feb. 2018, Open Savannah will be offering free five-week-long workshops to interested residents who <a href="https://opensavannah.org/apply-workshops">apply online</a> or by visitng Open Savannah's offices at 2222 Bull Street by Feb. 1, 2018. All workshops are geared toward beginners, and will be taught by Open Savannah Core Team Members or a specialist on the topic. We have no set-in-stone prerequisites for admission, but we will review applications to assess (a) how willing the individual is to learn in a collaborative setting and continue learning after the workshop series and (b) the level of need applicants may have in comparison to other applicants.

Courses seek to bridge the 'digital divide,' and offer opportunities for baseline training to those who otherwise could not afford formal studies. There is no age limit, but we do require that participants be at least 16 years or older. Students who successfully complete the five-week courses will receive a certificate of completion as well as, at the instructor's discretion, potential job recommendations and mentoring opportunities.

Only serious candidates should apply. We seek to foster an environment of collaborative, hands-on learning grounded in academic theory. If you own a laptop, great! If you don't own a laptop, we will on a case-by-case basis provide you with a loaner machine to use so you agree to a legally-binding agreement to return the laptop at the end of the course.

<h3>Data Literacy 101 – Applications Now Being Accepted</h3>
<h4>Instructor: Carl V. Lewis, M.Sc. in Data Visualization and Data Journalism, Columbia University; Owner, cvl.digital.</h4> 
 <em>This workshop introduces the data and tools available through Savannah Area Geographic Information Systems (SAGIS) as well as the U.S. Census Bureau. It also reviews the 4 C's of understanding and presenting data: correlation, characteristic, comparison, and change. THe instructor will walk participants through a “data hunt” and other exercises to apply the data concepts to the actual data provided through the Census Bureau's website. For each training given, the instructor will focus on one topic (e.g., health or student survey data). The framework of the course was created based on advice and materials produced by DataTherapy at the MIT Center for Civic Media.</em> <a href="https://opensavannah.org/apply-workshops">Apply here</a>
