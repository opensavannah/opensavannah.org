<h2>When We Meet</h2>
<p>Open Savannah regularly meets to discuss community ideas, work on civic tech projects and launch new projects into the wild. The fine folks at <a href="http://bullstreetlabs.com">Bull St. Labs</a> generously let us use their space to meet and hold events.</p>
<p>We hold two main types of regular events:</p>
<li><strong>Open Civic Hacknights:</strong> - Held biweekly on the second and fourth Wednesday of each month at Bull Street Labs, Open Civic Hacknights act as a way for us to regularly brainstorm, collaborate, work on ongoing projects, get to know each other and establish a recurring, unstructured time to meet. These are more casual, informal meetups.</li>
<li><strong>Community Idea Launchpads:</strong> - Held roughly once a month, these are larger, more community-wide evets that involve stakeholders from a wide sectors of disciplines who come together for a single evening for a 'mini-hacknight' to produce a civic app by the end of the event.</li>
