        <h3>Our Supporters</h3>
        <p class="lead">We rely on the help of financial, in-kind supporters and government partners to sustain our efforts tactically and financially. While Code for America subsidizes our operating costs, if Open Savannah is to continue its mission we will soon need the financial support of local sponsors,  By supporting Open Savannah with a tax-deductible contribution, your organization will receive recognition at our events and through our many communications channels. Funds go directly toward web hosting, meeting space, and food and beverages for our awesome volunteers.</p>
