        <h3>Our Supporters</h3>
        <p class="lead">We rely on the help of financial and in-kind supporters to sustain our efforts. While <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> subsidizes our operating costs, if Open Savannah is to continue its mission we will soon <strong>need</strong> the financial support of local sponsors,  By supporting Open Savannah with a tax-deductible contribution, your organization will receive recognition at our events and through our many communications channels. Funds go directly toward web hosting, meeting space, and food and beverages for our awesome volunteers.</p>
