        <h3>We visualize public data and deploy civic apps.</h3>
        <p class="lead">Open Savannah is a civic organization of local developers, designers, data geeks and ordinary residents who volunteer to help Coastal Georgia's public agencies and social enterprises adopt open web technologies. We're a citizen-driven platform for government innovation, and we use open data, design and creative technology as a mode for civic engagement.</p>
        <p class="lead">We pull together Greater Savannah's best resources to amplify our collective civic impact.</p>
        <h4>A Code for America Brigade</h4>
        <p class="lead">Open Savannah is only one among dozens of local volunteer groups that are part of the larger Code for America ecosystem.</p>
        <h4>Catalyzing the Open Data Economy</h4>
        <p class="lead">Accessible public data will enable the creation of local tech startups that solve real world problems.</p>
          <h4>Open Savannah is for everyone</h4>
        <p class="lead">If you think you won't fit in because you don't consider yourself a 'tech person,' we assure you there are plenty of ways to help out. For what it's worth, half of our <a href="/who-we-are/">Leadership Team</a> doesn't know how to code, either!</p>
