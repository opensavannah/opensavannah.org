    <h3>Local Civic Innovators and Creative Problem-Solvers</h3>
    <p class="lead">We are civic-minded residents committed to working with the City of Savannah, Chatham County and other municipalities in the greater Savannah area – as well as other nonprofit organizations – to make our region stronger. We’re here to help and eager to learn from professional public servants. And while we’re advocates for open government (we can’t build apps without open data!), we’re non-partisan and public-minded.</p>
    <p class="lead">We're a group of civic-minded programmers, coders, designers, and extraordinary citizens. We work in partnership with government, non-profit, and technical partners to deploy technology to improve quality of life for <em>all</em> residents and increase citizen engagement with civic issues.</p>
    
     <p class="lead">Ultimately, our goal is to make life better for residents by improving personal and collective outcomes through helping build local government services that are <em>better, faster, and cheaper</em> and have the greatest impact for the greatest amount of people who have the greatest need for assistance and efficient public services.</p>
   <h3>Open Savannah Leadership Structure</h3>
    <p class="lead">Open Savannah has three general tiers of leadership: Project Leadership, an Advisory Board, and the Executive Leadership Team. Project Leadership takes place on a fluid basis as new projects come about. Executive Leadership is elected by the outgoing Executive Leadership slate after two-years of service. The Executive Leadership appoints Advisory Board members as positions become vacant.</p>
