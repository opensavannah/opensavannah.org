    <h3>Connecting Citizens with their Communities</h3>
{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId %}
    <p class="lead">We leverage technology as a tool to connect citizens with community resources and each other. These connections empower citizen-driven solutions to problems previously addressed only by top-down approaches. New forms of civic engagement help governments do more with less and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of public services.</p>

<p><caption>The Knight Foundation classifies 'civic tech' as intersectional in nature.</caption></p>
    <p class="lead">We share a mission with our parent organization, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="lead">We build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.</p><p>We build civic applications by advocating for <a href="http://okfn.org">Open Data</a> policies and access that then empower residents to put data into new civic use-cases. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="lead">At Open Savannah, we try and keep the following goals in mind as we do this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>make it better to live in our city, county and state</li>
      <li>increase civic engagement</li>
      <li>learn and teach</li>
      <li>help anyone who wants to help</li>
    </ul>
