    Brian love solutions, or at least attempted solutions over problems.
    Figuring out puzzles and how to solve them is what makes him tick. Open
    Savannah is an opportunity for us, as citizens, to help provide solutions to
    the community we live in and to help solve problems with technology based on
    our skill sets. I help with project management, solution architecture and
    technical communication with our partners. In my professional life I've
    worked in technical project based consulting for both the public and private
    sectors.
